        I walked across an empty land
        <br>I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
        <br>I felt the earth beneath my feet
        <br>Sat by the river and it made me complete
        <br>
        <br>Oh simple thing where have you gone?
        <br>I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
        <br>So tell me when you're gonna let me in
        <br>I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
        <br>
        <br>I came across a fallen tree
        <br>I felt the branches of it looking at me
        <br>Is this the place we used to love?
        <br>Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
        <br>
        <br>Oh simple thing where have you gone?
        <br>I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
        <br>So tell me when you're gonna let me in
        <br>I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin
        <br>
        <br>And if you have a minute why don't we go
        <br>Talk about it somewhere only we know?
        <br>This could be the end of everything
        <br>So why don't we go
        <br>Somewhere only we know?
