        Come to me
        <br>In the night hours
        <br>I will wait for you
        <br>And I can’t sleep
        <br>Cause thoughts devour
        <br>Thoughts of you consume

        <br>I can't help but love you
        <br>Even though I try not to
        <br>I can't help but want you
        <br>I know that I'd die without you

        <br>Stay with me a little longer
        <br>I will wait for you
        <br>Shadows creep
        <br>And want grows stronger
        <br>Deeper than the truth

        <br>I can't help but love you
        <br>Even though I try not to
        <br>I can't help but want you
        <br>I know that I'd die without you

        <br>I can’t help but be wrong in the dark
        <br>Cause I’m overcome in this war of hearts
        <br>I can’t help but want oceans to part
        <br>Cause I’m overcome in this war of hearts
